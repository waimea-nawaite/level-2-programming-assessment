# Plan for Testing the Program

The test plan lays out the actions and data I will use to test the functionality of my program.

Terminology:

- **VALID** data values are those that the program expects
- **BOUNDARY** data values are at the limits of the valid range
- **INVALID** data values are those that the program should reject

## Board Layout

Do the coins randomly go into different positions without stacking in the boxes 

### Test Data To Use

I will test the code a couple times to see if the code isn't broken and randomly places the coins i different spots each time

### Expected Test Result

When the user runs the code it should say what coins are in the board then it will place them randomly in the boxes without stacking on top one another.
